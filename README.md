### Hi there 👋

Recently, here I am, not so safe, by the way my new tg id: @AvroraDonz2023

I wrote a second small blog to record my various experiences after becoming trans: https://donzstory.pages.dev

Recently, due to family reasons, there may be 淡圈.

Then there is... because of the attitude of the family, the underground party is 半糖... 半糖...

And, in most cases, I use more English than Chinese.

My tiny wish：
<ul> 如果你能记住我的名字，如果你们都能记住我们的名字，也许有一天我可以，我们可以，活在阳光之下，而不是永恒的白夜。   ————Donz </ul>
